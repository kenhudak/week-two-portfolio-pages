    Located halfway between <b>Ramadi</b> and Fallujah near Al-Taqaddum Air Base in Al Habbaniyah in Anbar Province, Iraq. In the late 1930s and 1940s Lake Habbaniyah was used by Imperial Airways as a refueling point and hotel for flying boats flying from the United Kingdom to India.

     Regulated supplies may be scheduled or demanded. However, the commander and his staff must closely control these supplies because of scarcity, high cost, or mission needs. Any item or group of items may be designated as regulated; normally some items in Classes II, III (bulk), IV, V, and VII are regulated. If an item is regulated, the commander who so designated it, must approve its release before it is issued. Items designated as command-regulated are identified in operation plans and orders.

  In order to be more compliant with the semantic web, the Chief Warrant Officer 2 abbreviation was noted using the following code:
  <code><xmp><abbr>title="Chief Warrant Officer 2">CW2</abbr></xmp></code>
